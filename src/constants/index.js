    advice: "We will work with local professional counseling centers, including the University of Illinois Counseling Center, and UIUC psychology students to provide counseling services to students."

    advice: "The whole counseling and therapy will be entirely online. It can not only reduce the costs but also enable students not to show their faces and names, which can eliminate privacy concerns for them."

  {
    advice: "We can organize peer support groups. Students can communicate with others who share a similar experience. Since it is online, students can choose to chat with others or speak through a voice changer to avoid personal identification if they wish."

    advice: "Our organization will collect data from our services and share it with other mental health organizations and professional counselors to better improve the mental health condition of students all over the world."
